# Flutter Study Jam Berlin - Session 1

This repository contains the code we wrote during the first session of the Flutter Study Jam Berlin. This is not the starter code for the Todo List application we're building throughout the upcoming sessions. That code can be found in the [FlutterStudyJam-Berlin/todo_app repository](https://github.com/FlutterStudyJam-Berlin/todo_app).

# Installation

Clone or download the repository to a directory of your choice. Assuming it is `~/flutter_app`, run the following commands to get started.

```bash
$> cd ~/flutter_app
$> flutter packages get
$> flutter run
```

Make sure that you either start an [Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator#runningemulator) or an iOS Simulator (`open -a simulator` in your terminal) before executing `flutter run`.
